The goal of r2dii.match is to match generic loanbook data with physical asset level data (ald).

## Installation

Install the development version of r2dii.match from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.match")
```

## Example

As usual, we start by using required packages. For general purpose functions we'll also use tidyverse.

```{r}
library(r2dii.match)
library(r2dii.dataraw)
library(tidyverse)
```

The following sections show the steps involved in the process.

### 1. Create two datasets: [loanbook](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/loanbook_description.html) and [asset-level data (ald)](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/ald_description.html)

This step is up to you. You must structure your data like the example datasets [`loanbook_demo`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/loanbook_demo.html) and [`ald_demo`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/ald_demo.html) (from the [r2dii.dataraw package](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw)).

```{r}
loanbook_demo

ald_demo
```

You may write _your-loanbook-template.csv_ and _your-ald-template.csv_ with:

```r
# Writting to current working directory 
loanbook_demo %>% 
  write_csv(path = "your-loanbook-template.csv")

ald_demo %>% 
  write_csv(path = "your-ald-template.csv")
```

You may then edit those files, save them as _your-loanbook.csv_ and _your-ald.csv_, and then read them back into R with:

```r
# Reading from current working directory 
your_loanbook <- read_csv("your-loanbook.csv")
your_ald <- read_csv("your-ald.csv")
```

But here we'll continue to use the `*_demo` datasets.

```{r}
your_loanbook <- loanbook_demo
your_ald <- ald_demo
```

(If you are following this code, be sure to skip the code chunk above, so it doesn't overwrite `your_loanbook` and `your_ald` datasets.)

### 2. Score the goodness of the match between the loanbook and ald datasets

`match_name()` first adds the column `simpler_name`, a modified version of the `name` column after applying best practices commonly used in name matching algorithms, such as:

* Remove special characters.
* Replace language specific characters.
* Abbreviate certain names to reduce their importance in the matching.
* Spell out numbers to increase their importance.

It then scores the similarity between `simpler_name` values in the prepared loanbook and ald datasets. 

```{r}
match_name(your_loanbook, your_ald)
```

By default, names are compared against ald names in the same sector (i.e. `by_sector = TRUE`). Use `by_sector = FALSE` removes this limitation, but it increases the matching run time on large datasets, and the amount of nonsensical matches. 

```{r}
match_name(your_loanbook, your_ald, by_sector = FALSE)
```

`min_score` allows you to pick rows at and above some `score`.

```{r}
matching_scores <- match_name(your_loanbook, your_ald, min_score = 0.9)

matching_scores
```

### 3. Write the output of the previous step into a .csv file

```r
# Writting to current working directory 
matching_scores %>%
  write_csv("matching-scores.csv")
```

### 4. Compare, edit, and save the data manually

* Open _matching-scores.csv_ with MS Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet editor.

* Visually compare `simpler_name_x` and `simpler_name_y`, along with the loanbook sector.

* Edit the data manually:
    * If you are happy with the match, set the `score` value to `1`.
    * Otherwise set or leave the `score` value to anything other than `1`.

* Save the edited file as, say, _matching-scores-edited.csv_.

### 5. Re-read the data from the previous step

```r
# Reading from current working directory 
matching_scores %>%
  write_csv("matching-scores.csv")
```

### 6. Join in validated matches in order of priority
