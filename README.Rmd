The goal of r2dii.match is to match loanbook data with asset level data (ald).

## Installation

Install the development version of r2dii.match with something like this:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")

# To install from a private repo, see ?usethis::browse_github_token()
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.match", auth_token = "abc")
```

## Example

This example aims to shows the entire matching process. As usual, we start by using required packages.

```{r}
library(r2dii.match)
library(r2dii.dataraw)
```

Before matching, both the loanbook and asset level data must be prepared.

```{r}
# All `r2dii.dataraw::*_demo` are fake datasets for examples

prep_loanbook <- r2dii.dataraw::loanbook_demo %>% 
  # identifies unique combinations of "loan-takers + sector"
  id_by_loantaker_sector() %>% 
  prepare_loanbook_for_matching()

prep_loanbook

prep_ald <- r2dii.dataraw::ald_demo %>% 
  prepare_ald_for_matching()

prep_ald
```

`match_all_against_all()` scores the similarity between `simpler_name` values in the prepared loanbook and ald datasets.

```{r}
# Using default `by_sector = TRUE`
matched <- match_all_against_all(prep_loanbook, prep_ald)

matched
```

You may use common dplyr functions to recover all columns from the loanbook dataset and to keep only rows at and above some threshold.

```{r}
threshold <- 0.9

matched %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(prep_loanbook, by = c("simpler_name_x" = "simpler_name")) %>%
  dplyr::filter(score >= threshold)
```
