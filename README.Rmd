The goal of r2dii.match is to match generic loanbook data with physical asset level data (ald).

## Installation

Install the development version of r2dii.match with something like this:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")

# To install from a private repo, see ?usethis::browse_github_token()
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.match", auth_token = "abc")
```

## Example

As usual, we start by using required packages. For general purpose functions we'll also use dplyr.

```{r}
library(r2dii.match)
library(r2dii.dataraw)
library(dplyr)
```

We'll use some fake datasets from the r2dii.dataraw package, which name ends with `_demo`, for example:

```{r}
loanbook_demo
```

Before matching, both the loanbook and asset level data must be prepared.

```{r}
loanbook <- prepare_loanbook_for_matching(loanbook_demo)
asset_level_data <- prepare_ald_for_matching(ald_demo)
```

`match_all_against_all()` scores the similarity between `simpler_name` values in the prepared loanbook and ald datasets. 

```{r}
matched_by_sector <- match_all_against_all(loanbook, asset_level_data)

matched_by_sector
```

By default, names are compared against ald names in the same sector. `by_sector = FALSE` increases the matching runtime on large datasets, and the amount of nonsensical matches. 

```{r}
match_all_against_all(
  loanbook, asset_level_data, 
  by_sector = FALSE
)
```

You can recover the `sector` column from the `loanbook` and `ald` dataset with `dplyr::left_join()`:

```{r}
matched_by_sector %>% 
  left_join(loanbook, by = c("simpler_name_x" = "simpler_name"))
```

You can also recover the `sector` column from the `ald` dataset with a similar strategy:

```{r}
matched_by_sector %>% 
  left_join(loanbook, by = c("simpler_name_x" = "simpler_name")) %>%
  dplyr::rename(sector_x = sector) %>%
  left_join(asset_level_data, by = c("simpler_name_y" = "simpler_name")) %>%
  dplyr::rename(sector_y = sector)
```

You may pick rows at and above some score with `dplyr::fileter()`:

```{r}
threshold <- 0.5
matched_by_sector %>%
  dplyr::filter(score >= threshold)
```

You may save the matched dataset with something like:

```r
readr::write_csv(matched, "path/to/save/matches_to_be_verified.csv")
```

You should verify and edit the data manually, e.g. with MS Excel or Google Sheets:

Compare `simpler_name_x` and `simpler_name_y` manually, along with the loanbook sector. If you are happy with the match, set the `score` value to `1` (only values of exactly `1` will be considered valid).

You may then re-read the validated data with:

```r
readr::read_csv("path/to/load/verified_matches.csv")
```

**Work in progress, next step of analysis it to join in validated matches in order of priority**.
