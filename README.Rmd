The goal of r2dii.match is to match generic loanbook data with physical asset level data (ald).

## Installation

Install the development version of r2dii.match from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.match")
```

## Example

We'll use required packages from r2dii, and some convenient packages from the tidyverse.

```{r}
library(r2dii.match)
library(r2dii.dataraw)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(
  library(tidyverse)
)
```

The process for matching loanbook and ald datasets has multiple steps:

### 1. Create two datasets: [loanbook](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/loanbook_description.html) and [asset-level data (ald)](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/ald_description.html)

Start by creating datasets like [`loanbook_demo`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/loanbook_demo.html) and [`ald_demo`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/ald_demo.html) (from the [r2dii.dataraw package](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw)).

```{r}
loanbook_demo

ald_demo
```

You may use these datasets as a template:

* Write _loanbook\_demo.csv_ and _ald\_demo.csv_ with:

```r
# Writting to current working directory 
loanbook_demo %>% 
  write_csv(path = "loanbook_demo.csv")

ald_demo %>% 
  write_csv(path = "ald_demo.csv")
```

* For each dataset, replace our demo data with your data.
* Save each dataset as, say, _your\_loanbook.csv_ and _your\_ald.csv_.
* Read your datasets back into R with:

```r
# Reading from current working directory 
your_loanbook <- read_csv("your_loanbook.csv")
your_ald <- read_csv("your_ald.csv")
```

Here we'll continue to use our `*_demo` datasets, pretending they contain the data of your own.

```{r}
# WARNING: Skip this to avoid overwriting your data with our demo data
your_loanbook <- loanbook_demo
your_ald <- ald_demo
```

### 2. Score the goodness of the match between the loanbook and ald datasets

`match_name()` scores the match between names in a loanbook dataset (lbk) and names in an asset-level dataset (ald). The names come from the columns `name_direct_loantaker` and `name_ultimate_parent` of the loanbook dataset, and from the column `name_company` of the a asset-level dataset. The raw names are first transformed and stored in the columns `alias_lbk` and `alias_ald`. Then the similarity between `alias_lbk` and `alias_ald` is scored using `stringdist::stringsim()`. The process to create the `alias_*` columns applies best-practices commonly used in name matching algorithms, such as:

* Remove special characters.
* Replace language specific characters.
* Abbreviate certain names to reduce their importance in the matching.
* Spell out numbers to increase their importance.

```{r}
match_name(your_loanbook, your_ald)
```

`match_name()` defaults to scoring matches between `alias_*` strings that belong to the same sector. Using `by_sector = FALSE` removes this limitation -- increasing computation time, and the number of matches with a low score.

```{r}
match_name(your_loanbook, your_ald, by_sector = FALSE) %>% 
  nrow()

# Compare
match_name(your_loanbook, your_ald, by_sector = TRUE) %>% 
  nrow()
```

`min_score` allows you to pick rows of a minimum `score` and above.

```{r}
matched <- match_name(your_loanbook, your_ald, min_score = 0.9)
range(matched$score)
```

### 3. Write the output of the previous step into a .csv file

Write the output of the previous step into a .csv file with:

```r
# Writting to current working directory 
matched %>%
  write_csv("matched.csv")
```

### 4. Compare, edit, and save the data manually

* Open _matched.csv_ with any spreadsheet editor (e.g. MS Excel, Google Sheets).

* Visually compare `alias_lbk` and `alias_ald`, along with the loanbook sector.

* Edit the data manually:
    * If you are happy with the match, set the `score` value to `1`.
    * Otherwise set or leave the `score` value to anything other than `1`.

* Save the edited file as, say, _matched_edited.csv_.

### 5. Re-read the data from the previous step

Re-read the data from the previous step with:

```r
# Reading from current working directory 
matched <- read_csv("matched_edited.csv")
```

### 6. Pick validated matches and prioritize by level

Pick validated matches, i.e. those with a `score` of 1.

```{r}
validated <- matched %>% 
  filter(score == 1L)
```

Here is an interesting view of the validated data.

```{r}
some_interesting_columns <- vars(id_lbk, level_lbk, starts_with("alias"), score)

validated %>% 
  select(!!! some_interesting_columns)
```

For each `id_lbk` there may be matches at multiple levels. To get only the best match, we set a priority for all possible levels, and we use it to pick one row per id.

```{r}
sorted_levels <- sort(unique(matched$level_lbk))
sorted_levels

prioritized_levels <- sorted_levels %>% 
  select_chr(
    # Showing off different tidyselect helpers
    starts_with("direct"), 
    matches("intermediate"), 
    contains("ultimate"), 
    everything()
  )
prioritized_levels

prioritized <- matched %>% 
  group_by(id_lbk) %>% 
  prioritize_at("level_lbk", priority = prioritized_levels) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Here is an interesting view of the prioritized data.

```{r}
prioritized %>% 
  select(!!! some_interesting_columns)
```

You may prioritize levels however you like.

```{r}
reverse_priority <- rev(prioritized_levels)
reverse_priority

matched %>% 
  group_by(id_lbk) %>% 
  prioritize_at("level_lbk", priority = reverse_priority) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(!!! some_interesting_columns)
```
