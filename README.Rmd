These tools allow you to match a loan book with asset level data.  This
implements in R the first step of the software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement
Capital Transition Assessment), which is a free tool that calculates the
alignment between financial assets and climate scenarios
(<https://2degrees-investing.org/>).  Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to
study how their capital allocation impacts the climate.

## Installation

Before you install r2dii.match you may want to:

* [Try an rstudio.cloud project that has r2dii.match already installed](https://rstudio.cloud/project/954051).
* [Learn how to minimize installation errors](https://gist.github.com/maurolepore/a0187be9d40aee95a43f20a85f4caed6#installation).

When you are ready, install the development version of r2dii.match from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.match")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(r2dii.match)
# r2dii.data is changing rapidly; ensure you have the latest version
# remotes::update_packages("r2dii.data", upgrade = "ask")
library(r2dii.data)
```

Matching is achieved in two main steps:

### 1. Run fuzzy matching

`match_name()` will extract all unique counterparty names from the columns: `direct_loantaker`, `ultimate_parent` or `intermediate_parent*` and run fuzzy matching against all company names in the `ald`:

```{r}
match_result <- match_name(loanbook_demo, ald_demo)
match_result 
```

### 2. Prioritize validated matches

The user should then manually validate the output of [match_name()], ensuring that the value of the column `score` is equal to `1` for perfect matches only.

Once validated, the `prioritize()` function, will choose only the valid matches, prioritizing (by default) `direct_loantaker` matches over `ultimate_parent` matches: 

```{r}
prioritize(match_result)
```

The result is a dataset with identical columns to the input loanbook, and added columns bridging all matched loans to their ald counterpart.
