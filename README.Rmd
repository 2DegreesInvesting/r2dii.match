The goal of r2dii.match is to match generic loanbook data with physical asset level data (ald).

## Installation

Install the development version of r2dii.match from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.match")
```

[How to minimize installation errors?](https://gist.github.com/maurolepore/a0187be9d40aee95a43f20a85f4caed6#installation)

## Example

We'll use required packages from r2dii, and some convenient packages from the tidyverse.

```{r}
library(r2dii.match)
library(r2dii.dataraw)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(
  library(tidyverse)
)
```

The process for matching loanbook and ald datasets has multiple steps:

### 1. Create two datasets: [loanbook](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/loanbook_description.html) and [asset-level data (ald)](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/ald_description.html)

Start by creating datasets like [`loanbook_demo`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/loanbook_demo.html) and [`ald_demo`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/ald_demo.html) (from the [r2dii.dataraw package](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw)).

```{r}
loanbook_demo

ald_demo
```

You may use these datasets as a template:

* Write _loanbook\_demo.csv_ and _ald\_demo.csv_ with:

```r
# Writting to current working directory 
loanbook_demo %>% 
  write_csv(path = "loanbook_demo.csv")

ald_demo %>% 
  write_csv(path = "ald_demo.csv")
```

* For each dataset, replace our demo data with your data.
* Save each dataset as, say, _your\_loanbook.csv_ and _your\_ald.csv_.
* Read your datasets back into R with:

```r
# Reading from current working directory 
your_loanbook <- read_csv("your_loanbook.csv")
your_ald <- read_csv("your_ald.csv")
```

Here we'll continue to use our `*_demo` datasets, pretending they contain the data of your own.

```{r}
# WARNING: Skip this to avoid overwriting your data with our demo data
your_loanbook <- loanbook_demo
your_ald <- ald_demo
```

### 2. Score the goodness of the match between the loanbook and ald datasets

`match_name()` scores the match between names in a loanbook dataset (lbk) and names in an asset-level dataset (ald). The names come from the columns `name_direct_loantaker` and `name_ultimate_parent` of the loanbook dataset, and from the column `name_company` of the a asset-level dataset. The raw names are internally transformed applying best-practices commonly used in name matching algorithms, such as:

* Remove special characters.
* Replace language specific characters.
* Abbreviate certain names to reduce their importance in the matching.
* Spell out numbers to increase their importance.

Then, the similarity  is scored between the internally-transformed names from the loanbook versus ald datasets. The scoring algorithm is `stringdist::stringsim()`.

```{r}
match_name(your_loanbook, your_ald)
```

`match_name()` defaults to scoring matches between name strings that belong to the same sector. Using `by_sector = FALSE` removes this limitation -- increasing computation time, and the number of matches with a low score.

```{r}
match_name(your_loanbook, your_ald, by_sector = FALSE) %>% 
  nrow()

# Compare
match_name(your_loanbook, your_ald, by_sector = TRUE) %>% 
  nrow()
```

`min_score` allows you to pick rows of a minimum `score` and above.

```{r}
matched <- match_name(your_loanbook, your_ald, min_score = 0.9)
range(matched$score)
```

### 3. Write the output of the previous step into a .csv file

Write the output of the previous step into a .csv file with:

```r
# Writting to current working directory 
matched %>%
  write_csv("matched.csv")
```

### 4. Compare, edit, and save the data manually

* Open _matched.csv_ with any spreadsheet editor (e.g. MS Excel, Google Sheets).

* Visually compare names from loanbook versus ald datasets, along with the loanbook sector.

* Edit the data manually:
    * If you are happy with the match, set the `score` value to `1`.
    * Otherwise set or leave the `score` value to anything other than `1`.

* Save the edited file as, say, _matched_edited.csv_.

### 5. Re-read the data from the previous step

Re-read the data from the previous step with:

```r
# Reading from current working directory 
matched <- read_csv("matched_edited.csv")
```

### 6. Pick validated matches and prioritize by level

The `matched` dataset may have multiple matches per loan. To get the best match only, use `priorityze()` -- it picks rows where `score` is 1 and `level` per loan is of highest `priority()`. 

```{r}
some_interesting_columns <- vars(id_2dii, level, score)

matched %>% 
  prioritize() %>% 
  select(!!! some_interesting_columns)
```

The default priority is set internally via `prioritize_levels()`.

```{r}
prioritize_level(matched)
```

You may use a different priority. One way to do that is to pass a function to `priority`. For example, use `rev` to reverse the default priority.

```{r}
matched %>% 
  prioritize(priority = rev) %>% 
  select(!!! some_interesting_columns)
```
