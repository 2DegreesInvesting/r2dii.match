The goal of r2dii.match is to match counterparties from a generic loanbook data with physical asset level data (ald).

## Installation

Before you install r2dii.match you may want to:

* [Try an rstudio.cloud project that has r2dii.match already installed](https://rstudio.cloud/project/954051).
* [Learn how to minimize installation errors](https://gist.github.com/maurolepore/a0187be9d40aee95a43f20a85f4caed6#installation).

When you are ready, install the development version of r2dii.match from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.match")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(r2dii.match)
library(r2dii.dataraw)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(
  library(tidyverse)
)
```

Matching is achieved in two main steps:

### 1. Run fuzzy matching

`match_name()` will extract all unique counterparty names from the columns: `direct_loantaker`, `ultimate_parent` or `intermediate_parent*` and run fuzzy matching against all company names in the `ald`:

```r
match_result <- match_name(loanbook_demo, ald_demo)
match_result 

```

### 2. Prioritize validated matches

The user should then manually validate `match_result`, ensuring that the `score` value is only equal to `1` for perfect matches. 
Once validated, the `prioritize()` function, will choose only the valid matches, prioritizing (by default) `direct_loantaker` matches over `ultimate_parent` matches: 

```r
priotize(match_result)

```

The result is a dataset, with identical columns to the input loanbook, and added columns bridging all matched loans to their ald counterpart.

For a more detailed walkthrough of the functionality [see the documentation](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.match/articles/r2dii.match.html)
