Description: These tools implement in R a fundamental part of
    the software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment),
    which is a free tool that calculates the alignment between financial
    assets and climate scenarios (<https://2degrees-investing.org/>).
    Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to study how their capital
    allocation impacts the climate. This package matches data from
    financial portfolios to data from market-intelligence databases (e.g.
    wind turbine power plant capacities), which is the first step to
    assess if a financial portfolio aligns with climate goals.
